## WCAG Compliance Considerations

While WCAG primarily applies to web content, its principles guide desktop application accessibility:

### Perceivable (Principle 1)
- **Current**: Visual-only status indicators
- **Recommendation**: Multi-modal feedback (visual + audio)

### Operable (Principle 2)
- **Critical Issue**: Success Criterion 2.1.4 Violation Risk
  - **SC 2.1.4**: Character-only keyboard shortcuts must satisfy one of the following:
    1. A mechanism is available to turn the shortcut off
    2. A mechanism is available to remap the shortcut to use one or more non-printable keyboard characters (e.g., Ctrl, Alt)
    3. The keyboard shortcut for a user interface component is only active when that component has focus
- **Current Problem**: Using Ctrl alone creates significant issues for screen reader users
- **Recommendations**: 
  - Default to multi-key combinations
  - Implement customizable hotkey settings
  - Auto-adjustment when screen readers are detected
  - Add timeout configurations for all timed operations

### Understandable (Principle 3)
- **Strength**: Simple, predictable interface
- **Recommendations**: 
  - Add help documentation in accessible formats
  - Clear warnings and guidance about hotkey conflicts

### Robust (Principle 4)
- **Strength**: Works with standard OS accessibility features
- **Recommendations**: 
  - Test with common assistive technologies
  - Integration with platform-specific accessibility APIs

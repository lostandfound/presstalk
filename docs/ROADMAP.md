# Roadmap

- Streaming UX
  - Partial results during capture; token-diff stabilization
  - Smarter finalize timing (VAD, overlap)

- Engine Options
  - Pluggable backends (e.g., whisper.cpp)
  - Model warmup and caching controls

- Hotkey & Paste
  - Custom combos (e.g., ctrl+space) with chord support
  - App-specific profiles; richer paste guard rules

- Reliability & Perf
  - Latency/throughput metrics; optional telemetry (local-only)
  - Graceful device reconnection and error surface

- UX & Packaging
  - Menu bar helper (macOS) for quick status
  - Signed app bundle or Homebrew formula
